date: 2018-11-29

## Abstract

The number of scientific articles is constantly increasing. It is sometimes impossible to read all the articles in certain areas. Among this great diversity of articles, some may be more interesting than others. It is difficult to select which articles are essential in a field. The contemporary way to judge the scientific quality of an article is to use the impact factor or the number of citations. However, these parameters may lead to a lack of certain articles that are not very well cited but are very innovative. It is therefore essential to ask the question of what makes an article fundamental in a field. Using the "fulltext" package in our Shiny web application we show how the analysis of a bibliography using a network is a good way to visualize the state of the art in a field.  We  searched for different parameters to judge scientific quality using data science approaches. Recent research has shown that the work of small research teams can lead to scientific innovations. In this sense, the analysis of scientific articles by global techniques could play an important role in the discovery of these advances.
